<p>Many thanks to all <tt>yoyocase.net</tt>  users. I built the site primarily for myself, but they
 give me ideas on how to make the site better.</p>

<p>Thanks also to the <a href="http://www.clevelandyoyoclub.com" target="_blank">Cleveland Yo-Yo Club</a>.
 I've learned a few tricks from and traded a few yoyos with its members.</p>
